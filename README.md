# Braziliian ecommerce (Olist) public dataset analysis
## 1. Project overview
In this project I want to analyze the Brazillian ecommerce publicly available dataset of orders using SQLite. For visualizations, I will use PowerBI Desktop and Python. 
## 2. Dataset information
This dataset is originally from Olist store, also available at Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce/data). Olist store is the largest department store in Brazillian marketplace where small businesses from Brazil can use to sell their products online. The shipment is handled also by Olist logistic parners. Once, the customer receives the product, the customer gets a satisfaction survey by email regarding his/her experience and write down some comments.
