### Question 2: Cohort Retention Analysis <br>
Question: What is the monthly cohort retention rate, and do any customer cohorts show repeat purchase behavior? <br>
Sub-questions: - Skipped due to renetion rate being 0% <br>
1. What percentage of customers make a second purchase within 1, 3, 6 months? <br>
2. How does retention differ by cohort (customers grouped by first purchase month)? <br>
3. Which cohorts show the strongest loyalty? <br>

## Key Findings: <br> 
Zero Customer Retention Across All Cohorts <br> 
1. Retention rate after initial purchase: 0% across all 23 monthly cohorts <br>
2. No customers made a second purchase within 1,3,4 or any subsequent months <br>
3. All 96,478 customers in the dataset made exactly one purchase <br>

### Cohort Characteristics: <br>
- Analysis period: September 2016 to August 2018 (23 cohorts) <br>
- Cohort size range: 1 to 7,289 customers per month <br>
- Largest cohort: 2017-11 with 7289 customers <br>
- Average cohort size: 4194 customers <br>

## Methodology: <br> 
Cohort Definition: Customers grouped by their first purchase month (e.g., all customers who made their first purchase in October 2017 form the '2017-10' cohort) <br>
Retention Calculation <br> 
Retention rate = (Customers returning in month N / Total cohort size) * 100 <br> 
- Identified each customer's first purchase date (cohort assignment) <br>
- Calculated time elapsed between first purchase and all subsequent orders <br>
- Aggregated by cohort and time period <br>
- Computed retention percentages <br>
Analysis limited to orders with status = 'delivered' to ensure completed transactions only. <br>

## Business Model Implications: <br>
The 0% retention rate indicates that Olist Operates primarily as a one-time purchase marketplace where: <br>
1. Customer Intent: Customers purchase specific Potential product/service satisfaction issues <br>
2. Product Categories: Likely dominated by durable goods, special occasion items, or one time needs <br>
